Formerly known as "Top10Memes", LEMMiNO began his career making videos ranking *Rage Comics*. Yeah, you read that right. Though, to be fair, that was back in 2012.
His content quickly adapted towards Top 10 Facts of different topics within Popular culture.

His golden age began in late 2015, when he announced his name change as well as his intention to create "longer and more serious videos in a sort of documentary-style, rather than Top 10s."

Since then he released 19 documentaries ([playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAhTBeRe8IhMmRve_rSfAgL_dtEXkKh8Z)), and they are some of the best content ever produced for YouTube.

**My personal highlights:**

Oh boy, Jay Foreman. I don't know anyone else who can combine education with such impeccable comedy.

His songs (e.g. [Singing one syllable out-of-sync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Een_AKh7Nik)) are just as good as his several series, namely [Unfinished London](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfxy4_sBQdxwf909hUFsM59Y0RC_k9fvV), [Politics Unboringed](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfxy4_sBQdxzZNqvVQXcBPvsl1Zgzy2-q) and, of course, [Map Men](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfxy4_sBQdxy3A2lvl-y3qWTeJEbC_QCp).

While his solo projects are great, his duo perfomance with Mark Cooper-Jones in Map Men is impeccable. Witty and educational, these lads live rent-free in my heart.
